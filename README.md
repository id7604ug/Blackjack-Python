# Blackjack-Python
This program is a blackjack game created in python.
There are two files that are used chips.txt and blackjack.py. The chips.txt stores 
the amount of chips the user has after a game is completed.
The game starts with a prompt for the users name and then prompts them the amount of chips that they have left. After showing
the amount of chips the user has, the user is prompted how many chips they would like to bet on the next hand. After the bet is placed the user nd the dealer are delt two cards each and the user is asked wether they would like to hit or stay. After the round is finished the program tallies the hand values and finds out if the user won. After one round is completed the user can choose to play another or to "cash out" and have their chips saved to the chips.txt file where the next time the program is loaded the user will have the amount of chips ther ended with.
